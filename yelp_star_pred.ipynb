Major companies active in the Indian 3D-printing market space are Altem Technologies, Imaginarium, Brahma 3, KCbots and JGroup Robotics.\\n\\n\\nIf you sit on Disney Research\\u2019s Magic Bench, you may have an elephant hand you a glowing orb. Or, a tiny donkey might saunter by and kick the bench. Similarly, scientists at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute are using the Microsoft HoloLens to explore complex biological network in 3-D, creating a tool that may help find critical links between proteins and genes related to disorders like cancer and diabetes. Both these examples highlight the melding of technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) with the real world to give users and businesses a world of the so-called \\u201cmixed\\\" reality (MR) or \\u201cblended\\\" reality concept.\\n\\n\\nWhile VR is all about a world created solely on computers or online, AR still deals with the real world and has elements of the virtual world built atop it, akin to layers of information. MR mixes both realities (VR and AR) in a bid to capture the best of both worlds. However, for mixed reality to gain traction, you need headsets and mixed reality content too.\\n\\n\\nRegardless, investors believe that mixed reality has the potential to become the next big computing platform. Consider this. No one had seen the Magic Leap One goggles ever. Yet, the company managed to raise investments of almost $2 billion, notably from Google, Alibaba Group, Temasek and JP Morgan Investment Management.\\n\\n\\nThis month, though, mixed reality headset maker Magic Leap finally announced that the Magic Leap One Creator Edition will be available in the US for $2,295. Other major players in the global MR market include Intel Corp., Seiko Epson Corp., Microsoft Corp., Accenture PLC., Google, Inc., Sony Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Facebook Inc., and HTC Corp. In India, we have start-ups like Imaginate Technologies Inc., too, which are increasingly betting on MR.\\n\\n\\nResearch firm Gartner Inc. predicts that by 2019, AR, VR and MR solutions will be evaluated and adopted in 20% of large-enterprise businesses.\\n\\n\\nThe global MR market size is expected to reach $2.8 billion by 2023, according to research firm Reportbuyer.com. It believes that the rapid growth will come from increasing demand for innovative and wearable products. The aerospace and defence sectors, it says, could use MR products for training programmes. The technology can also be used effectively in schools since it provides 3-D images, leading to an interactive learning experience, according to the report.\\n\\n\\nmint-india-wire long-reads TechnologyFuture of TechnologyArtificial IntelligenceBlockchainInternet of Things3D printingMixed RealityAugmented RealityVirtual Reality\", \"SECTION\": 1}, {\"STORY\": \"The statements in which Yeddyurappa says that the air strikes would benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) bag around 22 parliamentary seats in Karnataka, almost replenishing Pakistan's arsenal to attack and twist the intent with which India carried out the air strikes targeting terrorist training camps of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).\\n\\n\\n\\u201cMy statement is being reported out of context.

A strategy of whipping up Hindu religious pride in a state where 27% people are Muslims also seems to be paying off as it has polarized voters sharply.\\n\\n\\nIt looks like Balarampur town is painted in saffron. The mood is festive.

The village is celebrating the last two days of Ram Navami, a biannual Hindu festival, with blaring music. A resident from Ruchup village explains that it is easier to plug a saffron flag on the bicycles or at the entrance to homes, than display a BJP party flag which may invite the ruling TMC\\u2019s wrath. Here, in the Panchayat elections last year, the BJP won several seats despite widespread violence and intimidation by TMC workers, he informs.\\n\\n\\n\\u201cAfter the elections, elected members were coerced to join the TMC.

It has turned out that the entire case against her was made up to serve a political narrative. If you recall, during 2007-08, there were many bomb blasts in many cities across India and many people from the Muslim community were being arrested in these cases. The Muslim sentiment was going against Congress-NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) and so they thought of building a counter-narrative by creating this bogey of Hindu terrorism which has been demolished. Giving ticket to Pragya Thakur is the answer to that bogus narrative of Hindu terrorism. Hindu terrorism does not exist. As for her statements, I and the party have already said that she should not have made that remark against Hemant Karkare even though she may have some personal experiences and anguish. She should be careful in public life. But then, there are seasoned politicians who make mistakes. She is a new entrant and she will learn to observe restraint.\\n\\n\\nIn Maharashtra, it looks like Raj Thackeray is setting the agenda and the BJP is responding. Also, why do you think he has turned into a Modi-baiter from being a Modi supporter in 2014?\\n\\n\\nNot at all, in fact we are not responding at all. Whatever bare minimum response we are giving is because people should not accept his lies as truth. I don\\u2019t think he is going to have any impact anywhere in the state. Most of his claims that he has been making through those videos have been exposed as mere lies, like his claim that the National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met some Pakistani envoy just before the Pulwama attack. Actually, this meeting took place in 2017. Then, he said quoting some media report that no F-16 plane of Pakistan Air Force was shot down by India. But the Pentagon soon clarified that no such audit as claimed in the media report was carried out and our people also gave proof. Finally, one can quote anything out of context and we don\\u2019t need to respond to every lie. The only thing that has happened is that the Congress-NCP stand exposed. I think Raj Thackeray thought that the 2014 election ended his politics. Then he went to the Congress-NCP and is doing this to help them.

It uses cogs and gears to give it a smooth feel and has two open positions. First, it unfolds to 140 degrees \\u2014 handy if you want to put it down on your desk but still need to angle part of the screen for a video call, for example. Bend it further and the screen silently and solidly opens to a flat position. To close the phone, you click it out of the open position and snap the sides shut.\\n\\n\\nFully open, there's plenty of real estate on the Galaxy Fold's main screen, which measures 7.3 inches (18.5 centimeters) diagonally. It's great if you want to take and review photos, watch videos or read e-books without squinting. Multi-tasking is also possible with up to three apps open at the same time. Wide open, the Fold felt more like a small tablet than a smartphone, which suggests that one possible market is people who want both kinds of devices but don't want to buy two.\\n\\n\\nAs with anything that folds, there's a crease. It runs down the center of the screen and is visible at certain angles, though I didn't really notice it when using the apps.

As things stand, NYAY is taken to involve household pensions of \\u20b96,000 per month. This works out to \\u20b91,200 per month in per-capita terms, on average, assuming a household size of five. As an initial benchmark, individual pensions could be pegged at \\u20b91,200 per month. With the same budget, NYAY could cover 50 million household pensions of \\u20b96,000 per month, or 250 million individual pensions of \\u20b91,200 per month, or any other combination of household and individual pensions that covers about 20% of the population. This would help to depart from the rigidity of the 6x20 formula.\\n\\n\\nFOURTH, the first call on individual NYAY pensions should go to the elderly, widows and disabled persons. These individuals tend to live very deprived lives, not just among poor households. India already has a pension scheme for them, the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). As mentioned earlier, however, the central government contribution to NSAP pensions is abysmally low. Many states supplement this from their own funds, but even the supplement-inclusive amounts are small.\\n\\n\\nMoreover, NSAP covers only 33 million pensioners\\u2014barely one fourth of the reference group. Under NYAY, social security pensions for the elderly, widows and disabled persons could be universalized at an enhanced rate of \\u20b91,200 per month, plus state supplements. Better perhaps, the coverage could be \\u201cquasi-universal\\\": universal subject to well-defined exclusion criteria. NSAP has a good record, this is largely a matter of expanding the scheme.\\n\\n\\nFIFTH, on a similar note, NYAY could cover enhanced maternity benefits of \\u20b91,200 per month for six months, or even 12 months, for all pregnant women (except those already receiving maternity benefits in the formal sector). One possible concern is that this might hamper the drive towards lower fertility rates. But fertility rates are declining steadily, and India is now very close to the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman.\\n\\n\\nA minor reduction in the rate of fertility decline, if it happens at all, is perhaps not a major issue, compared with the need to protect the well-being of mothers and children. States like Tamil Nadu are already giving maternity benefits larger than what is being proposed here, and no spike in fertility has been reported there.\\n\\n\\nSIXTH, NYAY should also provide for automatic inclusion of some highly vulnerable groups such as particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs), nomadic tribes and manual scavengers. These groups are already identified to a large extent, in the population census or elsewhere. Jharkhand already has a pension scheme for all PVTGs, which seems to help them a lot. The rehabilitation of manual scavengers is an unresolved challenge that has haunted India for decades. NYAY may be the chance to cross that bridge.\\n\\n\\nSEVENTH, a reasonable proportion of NYAY pensions could be allocated at the discretion of gram panchayats and gram sabhas. Centralized identification of poor households is bound to involve substantial exclusion errors. Further, the economic status of a household varies over time, and it is difficult for centralized databases to keep up. Community identification, of course, raises its own problems, including the possibility of corruption and conflict. Leaving the allocation of all or most NYAY pensions to the discretion of gram panchayats and gram sabhas would probably be a mistake. However, there is a case for their having discretion over at least a small share of NYAY pensions, to reduce exclusion errors.\\n\\n\\nEIGHTH, NYAY pensions should be heavily concentrated in rural areas. The reason is that living conditions and economic insecurity are generally much worse in rural areas than urban areas. This is not always evident from, say, National Sample Survey (NSS) data on per-capita expenditure. Indeed, according to some NSS-based poverty estimates, urban poverty is as high as rural poverty in many states.\", \"SECTION\": 0}, {\"STORY\": \"The already affordable Mi TV 4A Pro has received a further slash in price in this sale.

Chandrashekar Rao\\u2019s daughter, is pitted against 185 candidates, most of whom are angry jowar and turmeric farmers demanding minimum support price (MSP) for crops. In an interview with Mint, Kavitha spoke about her constituency and said there are other regional parties who are \\u201ccovertly\\\" supporting the TRS\\u2019 idea of a federal front, which has been floated by her father. Edited excerpts:\\n\\n\\nMy constituency has a huge farmer base, who are very progressive. Our state government also gives a lot of importance to farmers in Nizamabad and the demand for MSP (by jowar and turmeric farmers) is a long pending issue. They protested in New Delhi before the state\\u2019s formation in 2013 to form a turmeric board, and (Union minister) Rajnath Singh had given assurances then.\", \"SECTION\": 0}, {\"STORY\": \"The Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (SP), Mayawati\\u2019s Bahujan Samaj Party and Ajit Singh\\u2019s Rashtriya Lok Dal have formed a pre-poll alliance.

Those and other issues have slowed Facebook\\u2019s growth and damaged its reputation, raising the hackles of lawmakers and regulators around the globe. Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized and vowed to fix the problems.\\n\\n\\nKnitting together Facebook\\u2019s apps is a stark reversal of Zuckerberg\\u2019s previous stance toward WhatsApp and Instagram, which were independent companies that he acquired. At the time that Facebook bought the firms, Zuckerberg promised WhatsApp and Instagram plenty of autonomy from its parent company. (Facebook Messenger was a homegrown messaging service, spun out of the main Facebook app in 2014.)\\n\\n\\nWhatsApp and Instagram have since grown tremendously, prompting a change in Zuckerberg\\u2019s thinking, said one of the people. The chief executive now believes tighter integration will benefit Facebook\\u2019s entire \\u201cfamily of apps\\\" over the long term by making them more useful, the person said. Zuckerberg had floated the integration idea for months and began promoting it more heavily to employees toward the end of last year, the people said.\\n\\n\\nThe effort has caused internal strife. Instagram\\u2019s founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, abruptly left Facebook last fall after Zuckerberg began weighing in more. WhatsApp\\u2019s founders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, departed for similar reasons. More recently, dozens of WhatsApp employees clashed with Zuckerberg over the integration plan on internal message boards and during a contentious staff meeting in December, said four people who attended or were briefed on the event.\\n\\n\\nThe changes may also raise questions of data privacy because of how user information may be shared between the services. Today, WhatsApp requires people to register only a phone number to sign up for the service. By contrast, Facebook and Facebook Messenger ask users to provide their real identities. Matching Facebook and Instagram users to their WhatsApp handles could give pause to those who prefer keeping their use of each app compartmentalized.\", \"SECTION\": 1}, {\"STORY\": \"The group has compiled a long list of what made 2018 so ominous, though many are examples of the public simply becoming newly aware of problems that have built up for years.

The trend towards outsourcing has already gained momentum over the past decades affecting support functions like accounting and human resources, and manual activities like facilities management and security. As businesses become more and more focused on core competencies, they will shed activities closer and closer to the core. The rapid rise of digital \\u201con-demand\\\" or \\u201csharing economy\\\" work platforms in the US, such as TaskRabbit, Upwork, Freelancer.com, is testament to what we will see in India.\\n\\n\\nIn a significant uptick, independent work will become more organized, more decent. The future of work may not hold full-time contractual jobs for all Indians, but it holds the promise of more gainful and decent work for many independent workers\\u2014delivery persons, cab drivers, self-employed snack food makers, contractual cleaners, to name just a few. These workers typically have a high degree of autonomy\\u2014they decide how much they work, and are paid for the tasks they perform or the output they produce rather than receiving fixed salaries against secure job contracts. As they become part of more organized, digitized value chains, independent workers will adopt systems that keep track of the work they do, use productivity tools, get training opportunities, and sometimes even benefits like subsidized healthcare or life insurance. A bathroom cleaner now has the chance to be a facilities manager of a franchise business (public toilets, in this case), with the discipline and formalization that comes from being part of an organized business.\\n\\n\\nBesides, a very positive outcome of such transformations would be that workplaces will become more diverse. Women hold just 25% of entry-level jobs in Indian firms compared to 45-50% in the Asia-Pacific region, by our survey, and shockingly only 4% of senior management jobs, compared to 11-13% in Indonesia and China, and up to 25 to 33% in Singapore and the Philippines. This could change, and quickly. More Indian women want to stay in work through life stages like marriage and maternity. Multinational companies and global value chains are influencing local firms to promote diversity. The demand for skills, like collaboration and teamwork, will make it imperative to recruit from diverse talent pools and normalize \\u201cflex\\\" at work. The future of work in India may look decidedly female.\\n\\n\\nFinally, as India\\u2019s labour force grows by 138 million people by 2030, it will be challenging to prepare new entrants for quality jobs of the future that require higher skills. Many of India\\u2019s schools, higher educational institutions, and skilling ecosystems are not geared up to this challenge. Much greater collaboration between the public and private sectors will be critical to bridge the gulf between what is taught in classrooms and what employers expect. Students will need early exposure to problem-solving, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), and data sciences to adjust to a data-driven and experimentation-oriented world. Countries like Estonia and the UK have introduced coding classes as early as age five or seven, in response to this.

Ikhwanis, also known as \\u201cfriendlies\\\", created its many bastions across north and central Kashmir much later.\\n\\n\\nThere is an instance of an overnight communal rioting on 20 February 1986, when 129 homes belonging to Kashmiri Pandits were damaged and 16 temples ransacked. Despite the perception damage caused by that event, Kashmiri Pandits, Sikhs, Deabandis, Barealvis, Mirzaisand Jamaatis, almost all faiths, sects and variants continue to co-exist in south Kashmir.\\n\\n\\nCongress was born in Srinagar but was rooted in south Kashmir. Syed Mir Qasim, Mufti Sayeed and many Congress veterans belonged to the region. Of the 10 chief ministers since 1947, four belonged to south Kashmir. In 1952, the man who negotiated with Pandit Nehru, the famous Delhi Agreement, was Mirza Afzal Beig, a resident of Anantnag. In 2014, the man who negotiated with BJP the controversial Agenda of Alliance was Dr Haseeb Drabu, a resident of Pulwama.\\n\\n\\nThe big change in the region came when Mufti Sayeed left the Congress and floated PDP in 1998. In 2002, when the party contested its maiden election on human rights plank, the region gave it 10 of 16 seats. With Congress and BJP supportive of his thought process, Sayeed managed to contribute to the ground situation positively. \\u201cWhen Mufti Sayeed took over, the idea was to withdraw the disturbed area act from the region because there was no militant violence,\\\" Wani said, insisting, \\u201cLater when Omar Abdullah replaced him, the idea was alive and was being favourably looked at.\\\"\\n\\n\\nIn 2008, PDP got 12 seats from the region simply on the basis of its earlier term. However, an NC-Congress alliance kept Mufti in opposition for six years. By early 2014, when PDP swept all the three Lok Sabha seats across Kashmir, BJP had risen with Narendra Modi as the leader. Given the BJP\\u2019s aggressive politics, this time Mufti sought a decisive mandate against the right wing party. The region gave him 13 seats in the assembly polls. Post-polls, he took more than two months to negotiate and finally shook hands with the BJP. Then all hell broke loose.\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI know of two south Kashmirs,\\\" one senior officer told this reporter. \\u201cThe one that existed in 2014 and the one that was born after 2014.

Bajoria, chairman of the SK Bajoria Group and one of the BJP\\u2019s Bengal leaders, claims that the reported violence is only 25% of reality, with counterclaims from the other side that some reports are grossly exaggerated. The BJP is using verbal, non-physical grammar to also stretch Mamata Banerjee\\u2019s political smarts to the limit. Nothing is beyond the pale of possible. In addition, the BJP has managed to get some key TMC members to cross the floor\\u2014former Lok Sabha member Mukul Roy and his strongman Arjun Singh (who is contesting against Trivedi) are a few examples.\\n\\n\\nThere are strange calculations and ground-level alliances that defy explanation. A good example is Asansol, which has an interesting demographic profile. Asansol is part of Bengal\\u2019s famed industrial hub with coal mines and steel factories dotting the landscape. The population has many non-Bengali migrant workers employed in the various factories around the area. It also has close to 20% Muslim population. The electoral waters have been muddied by the shutdown of various factories in the area, including public sector units Burn Standard Co. Ltd (a railway wagon manufacturer) and Hindustan Cables Ltd.\\n\\n\\nBabul Supriyo, former junior minister in the ministry of heavy industry, had won the 2014 elections by over 70,000 votes and has been nominated by the BJP again. In contrast, Mamata has fielded former actor Moon Moon Sen, daughter of popular Bengali actor Suchitra Sen. Moon Moon had won from Bankura in 2014 but fielding her from Asansol has everybody mystified. A TMC party worker in Asansol commented in frustration: \\u201cShe is like a 500-kg burden suddenly dropped on our backs.\\\"\\n\\n\\nSome political analysts see this as Mamata\\u2019s gift to Babul; her calculations probably show Babul winning again and she is perhaps loath to waste an asset from here. Moon Moon is a convenient candidate who has already spent a five-year term in Lok Sabha. Conversely, she might be fielding Moon Moon to force local heavyweights to unite and abandon their factionalism which is supposed to have cost the TMC the Asansol seat last time.\\n\\n\\nThis is evident from Moon Moon\\u2019s sparse public meetings, or her aversion to the heat-and-dust, rough-and-tumble of political campaigning, forcing the local organization to unite in the campaigning. In contrast, the BJP doesn\\u2019t have a strong or deep organizational presence in the region which then forces Babul Supriyo to often hit the road.\\n\\n\\nMoloy Ghatak, West Bengal law minister and Asansol resident, claims that Moon Moon Sen\\u2019s style of campaigning is different and far more intimate than her political rival.\\n\\n\\nBengal\\u2019s 42 seats, in some ways, will determine many fates. For one, it might turn out to be pivotal for the BJP which is trying to retain its leading position. BJP general secretary Amit Shah has set a target of 23 seats, up from the earlier halfway mark of 22 seats. Mamata has been claiming that the TMC will get all 42, but some of that is election rhetoric.\\n\\n\\nPolitical analysts and other observers are convinced that the BJP\\u2019s vote share will definitely jump from last time\\u2019s 17%, but how that translates into seats will depend a lot on the granular data, in particular the configuration of the assembly constituencies that vote for the saffron party.\\n\\n\\nThe consensus is the TMC will perhaps retain its leadership position, but the BJP will watch the voting pattern closely for a renewed assault during the 2021 Bengal assembly elections.\", \"SECTION\": 0}, {\"STORY\": \"While Modi blamed Congress for coining 'Hindu terror', Gandhi accused him of seeking to divide society along religious lines\", \"SECTION\": 0}, {\"STORY\": \"While the Tamil film starred Raghava in the lead role, the actor will take the director\\u2019s seat for the Hindi film\", \"SECTION\": 2}, {\"STORY\": \"\\u201cChoosing the path it does, allows Endgame to flash back to the many high points of this franchise\\u2019s 22 films, set up some great encounters, show the evolution of its characters right from the first threads of their spandex suits, and underline the camaraderie that is ultimately the greatest strength of this bursting-at-the-seams cast,\\u201d she wrote in her review\", \"SECTION\": 2}, {\"STORY\": \"Pigs, stray cattle and humans have appropriated the banks.

As tired workers emerged from its gates, the city would wake up. At 2 in the afternoon and at 10 at night, sirens would signal lunch and bed time, he remembers.\\n\\n\\nPost liberalization, Nagpur began to dither as her textile mills shut down and handlooms fell silent. Suddenly there was no future. No new industry sprang up. The city relied on government offices, small services, but as the state and central governments began to cut back on its humongous staff, Nagpur began to search for new avenues. There are small information technology companies. Nagpur has a bit of everything but nothing quite substantial. It craves for a sector that will resurrect its fledgling economy that is today driven by small trading and retail.\\n\\n\\nHigh dreamers leave Nagpur for Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru.

Both Pakistan (20%) and Bangladesh (21%) also have more women in the lower house of the parliament than India.\\n\\n\\nA feature of female political participation is that women are more likely to be fielded from constituencies reserved for the scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs). In 2014, 24% of all 670 women candidates were fielded from SC/ST seats. This figure has increased over time. This could be because reserved seats are seen as less competitive and present an easy starting point for women candidates, according to political scientist Francesca Jensenius . Data on elected women MPs suggests that this could be true. The proportion of women MPs elected from reserved constituencies is higher than those elected from general constituencies.\\n\\n\\nWhile the regional parties have challenged national parties to follow their lead and nominate more women candidates to the elections, our analysis reveals that leading national parties already field a higher proportion of women candidates than most regional parties.\", \"SECTION\": 0}, {\"STORY\": \"The Nokia 3.1, the most affordable of the lot, is now even more pocket-friendly.

There were expectations that the CAB would be placed before the Rajya Sabha before the government\\u2019s tenure ended. But the BJP surprised all by putting the CAB on hold. The anti-CAB forces celebrated what they thought was their victory, and Conrad Sangma became an urban legend. But holding back the Bill hasn\\u2019t sufficiently allayed the fears of the tribal minorities in the region who foresee a deluge of Hindu immigrants from Bangladesh, numbering 12 million.\\n\\n\\nIt is through this prism that one must view the electoral battle lines that are getting drawn in the North-East. The BJP, and its general secretary and chief organizer in the North-East Ram Madhav have enough political acumen to understand how torturous it is to enter the hearts and minds of the predominantly tribal, north-eastern states, especially in the backdrop of the recent anti-CAB protests. The BJP has therefore worked out its electoral plans very astutely by forming alliances with the regional parties, which makes better political sense. It is easier for the people of Meghalaya, for instance, to say they are voting for the NPP than to say upfront that they are voting for the BJP. People have learnt to identify the BJP with its Hindutva agenda and, more specifically, the beef ban and the lynching associated with those who are seen carrying beef or eating it. As tribes, they already feel hemmed in by their minority status, and as Christians, they consider it a double whammy to be under the BJP rule.\\n\\n\\nThe only state which may fall outside this broad categorization is perhaps Arunachal Pradesh, which plays politics a bit differently from the rest. In that state, members of legislative assembly (MLAs) can switch allegiances overnight without any qualms. Their dependence on the ruling government at Delhi is so acute that they don\\u2019t see why political ethics should deter them from straddling different political formations. Ideology, they say, makes no sense in politics. So, defections are common. After a tumultuous period in the Arunachal Pradesh legislature, which also had stints of President\\u2019s rule for 24 days between January and February 2016 followed by the suicide of then chief minister Kalikho Pul in August 2016, Pema Khandu, the present chief minister who was with the People\\u2019s Party of Arunachal, joined the BJP with 33 MLAs in January 2017. Khandu continues as the chief minister till date and the BJP has a total of 47 MLAs in the assembly, including the speaker. The Congress had three MLAs of which two left and joined the BJP. This is par for the course in Arunachal Pradesh.\\n\\n\\nThe BJP\\u2019s hatchet man in the North-East, Himanta Biswa Sarma who is known to be an Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) disciple, is also a shrewd game changer. He started what is known as the North-East Democratic Alliance on 24 May 2016 after the Assam state assembly elections were declared on 13 May 2016. In the elections, the BJP upstaged the Congress which had been ruling Assam for 15 years. The BJP won 60 of the 126 seats; it\\u2019s coalition partner the AGP got 14 seats; and the other pre-poll partner, Bodoland People\\u2019s Front, won 12 seats. This laid the foundation for the BJP\\u2019s expansionist plans in the North-East, which soon became most apparent in Tripura.\\n\\n\\nIn the Lok Sabha polls of 2014, the BJP in Tripura was not even a factor to reckon with. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPM, won both seats. By 2018, when Tripura went to the polls for the state assembly elections, the BJP managed to win 36 seats while its ally the Indigenous People\\u2019s Front of Tripura (IPFT) won eight seats. The CPM was reduced to 16 seats and the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Congress didn\\u2019t win any seat. The BJP then ensured Sunil Deodhar, the RSS pracharak who spent several years working in the rural areas of Meghalaya and speaks the local language fluently, was planted in Tripura to further the BJP\\u2019s expansionist policy. It is unimaginable how the Left bastion not only collapsed, but the BJP actually stormed the Bastille. What is surprising is that the IPFT has decided to go it alone in the Lok Sabha polls and has what it calls a \\u201cfriendly fight\\\" with the BJP, which has announced its own candidates. It is highly likely that both seats from that state would go the BJP way, more so because the CAB that created tremors in the other six was something that the substantial non-tribal section of Tripura wants in order to legitimize the large number of Bengali Hindu immigrants from Bangladesh.\", \"SECTION\": 0}, {\"STORY\": \"While companies are now saying that the reserve price for 5G spectrum is too high to even consider bidding, analysts say companies may not ignore the chance to upgrade for too long, especially given how aggressive they have been in the recent past with regard to upgrading their networks.\\n\\n\\nAirtel isn\\u2019t alone in its fundraising efforts.

As Standing points out: \\u201cVillagers\\u2019 increased purchasing power led to local farmers to plant more rice and wheat, use more fertilizer and cultivate more of their land. Their earnings went up, while the unit price of food went down.\\\" In fact, a similar thing happened with clothes. As people earned more, the demand for better clothes went up. Women in the villages saw this as an entrepreneurial opportunity. They bought sewing machines and material to sew new clothes. A new market was created where none existed. As Standing puts it: \\u201cA similar response could be expected in any community where there are people who want to earn more and do more.\\\"\\n\\n\\nEvidence from many such studies carried out in Africa seems to suggest the same. As a Unicef document titled From Evidence to Action: The Story of Cash Transfers and Impact Evaluation in Sub-Saharan Africa points out: \\u201cWith the exception of temporary price increases occurring during payment periods, there is no evidence that the cash transfers have led to inflation.\\\"\\n\\n\\nThere are a couple of other things that need to be stated here. Demonetisation destroyed a large part of the informal economy in India, rendering many Indians jobless. Of course, there is also the case of India\\u2019s demographic dividend, or the fact that 10-12 million Indian youth are entering the workforce every year and for whom enough jobs are not being created.\\n\\n\\nGiven this, as the Unicef document mentioned earlier points out: \\u201cIn an economy with high levels of unemployment, a stimulus programme like cash transfers (which is what any basic income scheme basically is) may increase the local labour demand without exerting significant upward pressure on wages.\\\"\\n\\n\\nOf course, one also needs to take into account the fact that NYAY, if ever implemented, will be the largest basic income scheme in the world. Hence, it will be important to implement it gradually across the length and breadth of India, to rein in any danger of inflation. While NYAY is not UBI in the strictest sense of the term, the Economic Survey 2016-17 essentially states that a guiding principle for UBI is gradualism. The Congress has talked about phased implementation.\\n\\n\\nIn the Indian case, this concern comes from a patriarchal view of the society. As Arvind Subramanian writes in Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy, \\u201cIf men control the wallet, as they often do, cash transfers would be imprudently used\\u2014and used more in line with the preferences of adult males than the real needs of the family\\u2014which would make women and children worse off.\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe point being that if you give men the money, they will spend it on alcohol and tobacco. But is that really the case? As the Economic Survey 2016-17 points out: \\u201cOne can define consumption on alcohol, tobacco and paan as consumption on \\u2018temptation goods\\u2019. The main finding is that these goods form a smaller share of overall budget/consumption as overall consumption rises. This is an indication that an increase in income from UBI alone will not necessarily lead to an increase in temptation goods consumption.\\\"\", \"SECTION\": 0}, {\"STORY\": \"The company has decided to take action against accounts which are promoting vaccine hoaxes that have been publicly identified by the World Health Organisation and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, US.\\n\\n\\n\\\"We want to give people more accurate information from expert organisations about vaccines at the top of results for related searches, on Pages discussing the topic, and on invitations to join groups about the topic,\\\" Monika Bickert, Vice President, Global Policy Management, Facebook wrote in a blog-post on Thursday.\\n\\n\\nAs part of the initiative, the Facebook Pages that spread misinformation about vaccinations in News Feed and Search would not be included in recommendations or predictions.\", \"SECTION\": 1}, {\"STORY\": \"A unique & an unconventional tale of love and romance #YoursTruly premiering 3rd May on #ZEE5\\u201d she wrote alongside the poster\", \"SECTION\": 2}, {\"STORY\": \"While smart speakers like Amazon\\u2019s Echo devices and the Google Home are useful for controlling these lights via voice, all of them can be controlled with smartphones as well\\n\\n\\nNEW DELHI: The internet of things ecosystem in India may not have developed fully just yet, but companies have been pumping in smart lights into the country.\\n\\n\\nWhile smart speakers like Amazon\\u2019s Echo devices and the Google Home are useful for controlling these lights via voice, all of them can be controlled with smartphones as well.

But users looking for something to post about are immediately recruited into group challenges, or hashtags, or shown popular songs. The bar is low. The stakes are low. Large audiences feel within reach, and smaller ones are easy to find, even if you\\u2019re just messing around.\\n\\n\\nOn most social networks the first step to showing your content to a lot of people is grinding to build an audience, or having lots of friends, or being incredibly beautiful or wealthy or idle and willing to display that, or getting lucky or striking viral gold. TikTok instead encourages users to jump from audience to audience, trend to trend, creating something like simulated temporary friend groups, who get together to do friend-group things: to share an inside joke; to riff on a song; to talk idly and aimlessly about whatever is in front of you. Feedback is instant and frequently abundant; virality has a stiff tailwind. Stimulation is constant. There is an unmistakable sense that you\\u2019re using something that\\u2019s expanding in every direction. The pool of content is enormous. Most of it is meaningless. Some of it becomes popular, and some is great, and some gets to be both.

In doing so, it \\u201cmoved\\\" more quickly than a wriggling peer. It didn\\u2019t understand its evolutionary priority as \\u201ccreature-like locomotion.\\\" It needed to get to a certain place as efficiently as possible. And it did.\\n\\n\\nOlder social apps are continuously evolving, too. Their models prioritize growth and discovery, of course, but also assume the centrality of your people: the accounts you follow and which follow you, or with whom you communicate directly, and are bound up in their founding myths and structures: Facebook\\u2019s social graph; the News Feed; the Instagram feed; Twitter\\u2019s rigid user relationships.\\n\\n\\nTikTok though is the towering stick falling far and fast, not caring to wait to evolve through a wriggling, cumbersome social phase, but instead asking: Why not just start showing people things and see what they do about it? Why not just ask people to start making things and see what happens? If engagement is how success is measured, why not just design the app where taking up time is the entire point? There\\u2019s no rule, in apps or elsewhere, against engagement for engagement\\u2019s sake. Let the creature grow tall and fall upon us all.\\n\\n\\nTikTok is far from an evolutionary fluke. Its parent company, ByteDance, recently valued at more than $75 billion, bills itself first as an artificial intelligence company, not a creator of mission-driven social platforms.

Our estimates suggest potential for substantial net job growth in all sectors barring agriculture. The blockbuster occupations of the future for India, based on our estimates, include:\\n\\n\\nBuilders: India could see demand for an incremental 60 million workers in building and construction activities by 2030, assuming higher rates of investment in infrastructure, and residential and commercial construction. This means more jobs for architects, surveyors, engineers, electricians, carpenters, plumbers and construction labourers.\\n\\n\\nCustomer interaction and creatives: Demand for retail salespeople, food preparers and handlers, artists, designers, entertainers, and similar categories of workers engaged in consumer interactions and activities, could rise by 23 million by 2030, as higher incomes create more consumption, with people shopping, travelling, eating out, and engaging in recreational activities.\\n\\n\\nCare providers: The future could see an explosion of demand for workers in healthcare services, to the tune of 13 million workers by 2030 in India. This is driven partly by global aging: spending on hospital care for an 85-year-old American is more than five times higher than for those 19 to 44 years old. Shifting demographics could create incremental demand for 51 million to 83 million workers globally such as home health aides, personal care aides, and nursing assistants. Much of the new demand will come from aging economies, such as Japan, China, or Germany, but India could export a trained healthcare workforce and will also face rising demand for their own healthcare needs.\", \"SECTION\": 1}, {\"STORY\": \"WhatsApp is also working on making information about forwarded messages more accessible to reduce misinformation.

Maybe it\\u2019s an old car with some piece of its chassis loose and scraping the road surface as the car speeds past. Maybe it\\u2019s the wheels of a train against the rails it rides on, as it picks up speed.\\n\\n\\nWhy do we see those sparks? You think \\u201cfriction\\\" and you\\u2019re right, but that\\u2019s only a partial explanation. That is, it\\u2019s not just friction that\\u2019s the cause. For example, you wouldn\\u2019t see such sparks if the car dragged a rod made of plastic or wood along the ground. There is certainly friction, and it might wear away the rod, but you don\\u2019t see any sparks. Try a palm frond, or a tablecloth, or a newspaper, or the pretty stilettos Poorna aunty gave you. No sparks from any of those. A glass bottle? It will simply shatter, and right away.\\n\\n\\nFor sparks to appear, the substance that\\u2019s dragged along the ground needs to be \\u201cpyrophoric\\\", a word whose Greek root means \\u201cfire-bearing\\\". A pyrophoric material is prone to spontaneous ignition under certain conditions, without necessarily being heated to high temperatures. Many relatively obscure substances have this property and must therefore be handled with some care. But some familiar substances are also pyrophoric: Aluminium and iron, for example.\\n\\n\\nI\\u2019m guessing you read that last sentence and your brow wrinkled. You are wondering why your aluminium thali, or your house keys and the always rusting keyrings, have never spontaneously caught fire. The point here is my mention above of \\u201cunder certain conditions\\\". Those conditions are met when objects made of these metals are subjected to friction, like with the surface of a road. What happens then is that the friction chips away tiny pieces of the metal, and these pieces spontaneously ignite as they fly through the air, and voil\\u00e0: The shower of sparks that you\\u2019ve seen plenty of times.\\n\\n\\nThis is the mechanism at work in more common cigarette lighters, or in now obsolete guns known as \\u201cflintlocks\\\". In the guns, for example, a small and sharp piece of hard stone called flint is held cocked in position. When the trigger is pulled, it rapidly rotates forward and strikes a piece of steel. The friction between flint and steel shears off small shards from the steel. They ignite, and that shower of sparks is directed into a little pan filled with gunpowder. In turn, the gunpowder ignites and\\u2026well, you get the picture: The gun fires. With the cigarette lighter, it\\u2019s much the same. When your thumb turns that minuscule wheel, it rubs against a piece of metal and scrapes off tiny pieces that catch fire. At the same time, you\\u2019re releasing some of the fuel from inside the lighter and\\u2026well, you get the picture again: You have a flame. (Not that I\\u2019m suggesting that you smoke.)\\n\\n\\nSo, if you now have an idea of how those sparks you see so often are formed, what is the connection to helicopters, and to military ones at that?\", \"SECTION\": 1}, {\"STORY\": \"The neighbour, a divorcee, is a cold man, who stops believing in love after being shunned by his first wife\", \"SECTION\": 2}, {\"STORY\": \"Apart from this, Sudeep is also a part of Chiranjeevi\\u2019s Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy and will be seen in Dabangg 3, starring Salman Khan\", \"SECTION\": 2}, {\"STORY\": \"The official logline of the third season reads: President Kirkman (Sutherland) will face a political reality campaigning\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWhat does it take to make a leader?

It means that if there was a high percentage of polling during the 2014 Modi wave and the same levels are being nearly maintained this time, there has to be something that is causing high level of polling this time. What is the difference this time? The difference is in 2014, since there was a huge wave among the middle-class, you could feel the euphoria because that is the vocal class. Now, the middle-class is already there, they are voting for Modiji and the wave this time is more powerful among the people in the lower strata of the society.

But the poor are not as vocal as the middle-class, they do not show their euphoria the way the middle-class does, they are not part of any pre-poll survey or exit polls but this time, the Modi wave is led by these people and we can sense it.

(PTI)\\n\\n\\nIf and when Congress' Nyuntam Aay Yojana, or NYAY scheme, for minimum income guarantee is implemented, it'll be the biggest basic income globally. Here's a snap analysis\\n\\n\\nOn 25 March, Congress president Rahul Gandhi announced the Nyuntam Aay Yojana, or NYAY scheme. The plan is to give \\u20b96,000 every month to the bottom 20% of the population of around 5 crore families or 25 crore individuals. Gandhi\\u2019s proposal is not that of universal basic income (UBI), of which there has been a lot of talk in the recent past. UBI is basically a small amount of money paid every month to every citizen of a country, without any terms and conditions. In the case of NYAY, the plan is to pay money to the bottom 20% only and not every citizen as UBI envisages.\\n\\n\\nIf and when it is launched, NYAY will be by far the biggest basic income scheme anywhere in the world. Given that there are valid concerns on the viability of the scheme and the impact it is likely to have on the Indian economy, we try and address some of the concerns in detail.\\n\\n\\nThis concern comes from the fact that the government will be distributing free money under the NYAY scheme with no conditions attached. If one looks at the PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi scheme, it is already doing the same though to families which own agricultural land of less than two hectares. Of course, the amount in case of PM-KISAN is much lower at Rs2,000 per quarter against the \\u20b96,000 per month promised under NYAY. But ultimately free money is free money, irrespective of whether it is being given by the current government or proposed by an opposition party.\\n\\n\\nAlso, anyone who looks at basic income as something for nothing, should have issues with other forms of the same phenomenon. Guy Standing, an economist at the School Of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, writes about this in Basic Income: And How We Can Make It Happen, \\u201cAnyone opposing basic income on this ground (free money) should also oppose all wealth inheritance and all other forms of income that are not derived from productive activity\\u2026 They should oppose all the selective tax breaks\\u2026 which mostly benefit the affluent who have done nothing to \\u2018earn\\u2019 them.\\\"\\n\\n\\nThis concern stems from the fact that incomes of a large section of population will go up suddenly. This higher income will chase the same set of goods and services available in the market and will ultimately lead to higher prices. In theory, this makes immense sense. When people suggest that basic income schemes will lead to inflation, they tend to believe that the supply of goods and services will continue to remain the same, despite an increase in income. The trouble is that there is a lot of evidence to the contrary.\", \"SECTION\": 0}, {\"STORY\": \"London: Nickel prices climbed to a six-month peak on Monday as expectations of a fourth consecutive year of supply deficit were reinforced by signs of robust demand from stainless steel mills in China.\\n\\n\\nBenchmark nickel on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 0.5% at $13,260 a tonne by 1037 GMT, having touched its highest since the end of August at $13,405.

China\\u2019s National Intelligence Law of 2017 requires all Chinese companies and citizens to 'assist in and cooperate in national intelligence work' if requested. Whether Huawei or any of its employees have done so in the past is now incidental, China hawks argue, given Huawei\\u2019s lead in developing 5G technologies for the future.\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWhen people realized Huawei is effectively the only provider of 5G, they had to do something,\\u2019\\u2019 says James Mulvenon, a China specialist formerly with RAND Corp. who now works for defense contractor SOS International LLC of Reston, Virginia. 'Nobody is looking for a smoking gun anymore. They\\u2019re looking at the potentiality argument. If the [People\\u2019s Liberation Army] comes to them, they have no way of saying no.'\\n\\n\\nIn his interview, Huawei CEO Ren said he would decline any request from Beijing for sensitive information on clients and stressed the potential for cooperation with the US and other countries on 5G and other matters. \\u201cHuawei firmly stands on the side of customers when it comes to cybersecurity and privacy,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\nThe executive order under consideration, for possible issuance in February, wouldn\\u2019t mention specific companies like Huawei and wouldn\\u2019t ban US sales by the firms, according to a person familiar with the matter. But it would empower the Commerce Department to review products and purchases by companies connected to adversarial countries, including China, this person said. A bipartisan bill recently introduced in Congress would take the more draconian step of banning sales of US parts to Huawei and its Chinese counterpart, ZTE Corp., which could drastically curtail their businesses. Another bill would set up a White House office to coordinate federal efforts to blunt technology threats from China.\\n\\n\\nThe Trump administration is also stalking Huawei in other ways. Its most provocative act so far was asking Canada to arrest Huawei\\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver last month on fraud charges linked to alleged Iran sanction violations, which Huawei denies. Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren, is out on bail awaiting possible extradition to the US. Her arrest \\u201cwould never, never, ever have happened\\\" before the Trump pivot to confronting China, says Spalding, the retired Air Force general. \\u201cWhat you\\u2019re seeing is the beginning of a change in how the federal bureaucracy treats China.\\\"\\n\\n\\nElsewhere, US investigators in Seattle are looking into possible criminal charges against Huawei for alleged theft of trade secrets from US partner T-Mobile US Inc. The probe includes allegations that a Huawei engineer stole information when visiting a T-Mobile lab in Bellevue, Washington, to see a diagnostic robot called \\u201cTappy\\\" that simulated a person\\u2019s phone use, according to one person familiar with the matter. In a 2014 lawsuit, T-Mobile alleged a Huawei engineer slipped one of the robot\\u2019s fingertips into his laptop bag during the visit and left with it. The jury sided with T-Mobile in 2017, saying T-Mobile should get $4.8 million in damages for breach of contract. The parties later agreed to drop the case after settlement talks.\\n\\n\\nChina\\u2019s foreign ministry said on Jan. 17 that the legal dispute between Huawei and T-Mobile was resolved in court and expressed concern about the motives behind the \\u201creinvestigation.\\\"\\n\\n\\nOn Jan. 11, authorities in Poland arrested a former Polish intelligence official and a Chinese employee of Huawei and accused them of spying for China.

One of the main reasons for this development in American cities is the availability of cheap fuel. The repeated cycle of densification and de-densification continues as cities expand spatially. Irrespective of the country, what is evident is that urban sprawl negatively impacts a city\\u2019s sustainable growth.\\n\\n\\nCities around the world have used various strategies to address this sprawl. While Portland (Oregon, US) has set a city boundary to stop peri-urban areas mushrooming, other cities have taken a transit-oriented approach to reinstate densities. Curitiba (Brazil) has initiated a land-use programme channelling development around bus rapid transit corridors. Several new cities in China have built metro transit lines before settlements, to encourage transit-oriented growth.\\n\\n\\nMobility is a factor of growth and pride for many cities. In India, this is evidenced by the focus on metro rail development, from Bengaluru to Ahmedabad, and embodied by the value of Mumbai\\u2019s suburban rail or Delhi\\u2019s impressive transit network.\\n\\n\\nSecondly, it is critical to recognize the evolution of the city resident. A generation that carries mobile phones with a GPS unit and has constant data connectivity has a different reverence for time and changing expectations of the physical environment. The cost attached to the commute is not to the liking of the new-age city resident.\\n\\n\\nThe 2011 Census, conducted before the rise of digitized shared mobility in India, found that 77% of all work trips in urban India are by sustainable mobility modes\\u2014bus (16.3%), cycle (18.7%), walk (32.3%), intermediate public transport (4.3%), train (5%), and other modes (1.2%).

However, authorities across the world are now showing increasing interest. China which has one of the largest CCTV networks in the world, with 170 million cameras across the country, is using a new surveillance system developed by the Chinese AI startup Watrix, which can identify individuals from a distance of 50 meters based purely on the shape of their body and style of walk.\\n\\n\\nExperts, however, believe that gait analysis is still at a very nascent stage and more research is required to attain results which are more precise.\\n\\n\\nA joint team of researchers from the Netherlands Forensic Institute, in a paper published in Forensic Sciences Research in February 2018, acknowledge the veracity of gait analysis but also argues that humans can adjust their gait according to circumstances. It also claims that the quality of the footage, frame rates, and the lack of solid scientific knowledgebase about intra and inter-subject variability in gait features can affect the analysis.\\n\\n\\nHowever, there are studies which suggest that a careful examination of the walking style of a suspect with that of the criminal in the CCTV footage by skilled observers can nudge authorities in the right direction. One such study was carried out by a leading British forensic gait analyst, Ivan Birch, in 2013. Published in the Science and Justice Journal, the study hired seven gait analysts and asked them to examine five CCTV samples, where each sample showed a target walker and five suspect walkers, to determine which of the suspect walkers was the target walker. All the walkers were wearing identical loose-fitting clothing to mask their body contours and had their faces covered. At the end of the study, the analysts correctly identified the suspect walker in 71% of the cases. However, it was also found that correct decisions were higher in cases where the footage of the target walker and that of the suspect walker were captured from the same angle by the CCTV camera.\\n\\n\\nA major limitation of forensic gait analysis is the fact that it often requires interpretation of research that has been conducted under controlled environments through clinical gait analysis, claims a joint report by the Royal Society of Scotland and the Judicial College published in November 2017.\\n\\n\\nIt argues that unlike forensic gait analysis, clinical gait analysis is more planned and organized, with multiple cameras and sophisticated equipment to capture every little detail related to a person\\u2019s gait in order to carry out three-dimensional measurements. Whereas, in forensic gait analysis, experts often have to rely on CCTV camera footage which may not always be in the ideal position or may be marred by poor lighting or camera quality, often resulting in angles being estimated from a two-dimensional video.\\n\\n\\nThen, there is the question of how unique is a person\\u2019s gait.

How did we accept Uber as the high point?\\n\\n\\nThirty years ago, one March day in 1989, at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Geneva, 33-year-old British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee handed his boss Mike Sendall a note, blandly titled Information Management: A Proposal. The abstract of the proposal read: \\u201cThis proposal concerns the management of information about accelerators and experiments at CERN. It discusses the problems of loss of information about complex evolving systems and derives a solution based on a distributed hypertext system.\\\"\\n\\n\\nSendall read the proposal and wrote on its first page: \\u201cVague but exciting\\u2026\\\" After some thought, he gave Berners-Lee the go-ahead. And the internet was born.\\n\\n\\n(Technically, no. What Berners-Lee\\u2014now Sir Tim Berners-Lee\\u2014invented was the World Wide Web, not the internet. The internet already existed; it was essentially a wide-area network (WAN) of computers which let the users talk to one another and share data. The internet is infrastructure while the Web is a service on top of that infrastructure. As someone put it, one can think of the internet as a bookstore and the Web as the collection of books in that store. So, Sir Tim\\u2019s invention made the internet what it is today. Thus, in practical terms, March 2019 marks 30 years of the Internet.)\\n\\n\\nIt is obviously the ultimate clich\\u00e9 to say that the internet has immeasurably changed the world. There is perhaps no aspect of our lives\\u2014public or private\\u2014that has not been impacted by the net. It has been an immensely powerful force of good, and it has only covered half the planet\\u2019s people till now. We also know that there is much more that it can deliver\\u2014its scope is only limited by our imagination.\\n\\n\\nNo one seems to have any clear figure about how much the internet has helped the global economy, except for a 2011 McKinsey Global Institute report which said: \\u201cThe internet accounted for 21% of the gross domestic product growth in mature economies over the past five years. If we include the large, emerging economies of China, India, and Brazil, the internet accounted for 11% (of growth) over the past five (years).\\\" But that was 2011. Much has changed since then, especially in terms of the growth of the internet in China and India.\\n\\n\\nSo why has Sir Tim Berners-Lee, in an interview to BBC earlier in March, said that global action is required to tackle the Web\\u2019s \\u201cdownward plunge to a dysfunctional future\\\"?\\n\\n\\nIn an open letter (bit.ly/2VRCKWb) released on 12 March, Sir Tim said: \\u201cWhile the Web has created opportunity, given marginalized groups a voice, and made our daily lives easier\\u2026it\\u2019s understandable that many people feel afraid and unsure if the Web is really a force for good.\\\"\\n\\n\\nIn 2013-2014, China\\u2019s People\\u2019s Liberation Army\\u2019s hackers stole 21.5 million personnel files from the US Office of Personnel Management.

Huawei has become a world leader in manufacturing networking equipment and is striving to dominate the next generation of wireless technology, known as 5G. The Trump administration, convinced Huawei is a Trojan horse for Chinese intelligence, is determined to blunt its growing sales and influence. The heightening tension, which is said to include a potential presidential order that won\\u2019t name Huawei but would greatly limit its and other companies\\u2019 US business opportunities, stems from a fundamental hardening of US policy toward China that took place in 2017 during Trump\\u2019s first year in office.\\n\\n\\nFor a decade, US officials have said Huawei may be acting as an arm of the Chinese state, a private company in name only whose ulterior mission, they claim, is to steal government and corporate secrets through conventional espionage and back-door bugs in its telecom gear. The Obama administration stopped Huawei from acquiring US technology assets and exerted pressure that reportedly helped nix a $5 billion equipment deal with Sprint that would have saved the struggling US carrier $800 million in its first year. Last summer, Congress barred federal agencies and contractors from buying Chinese networking gear, and now the Trump administration is preparing an executive order that could significantly restrict all Chinese telecom sales in the US, two people familiar with the matter said earlier this month.\\n\\n\\nThrough it all, Huawei has prospered. The company garners about half its annual revenue of $92 billion outside China, led by Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where cutting-edge technology at affordable prices has endeared the Chinese company to budget-strapped purchasers.

Gowda, who appears only to have aged in numbers and not in spirit, has been relentlessly campaigning for himself, his two grandsons and even other candidates of the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular), or JD(S), coalition across several parts of southern Karnataka that went to the polls on 18 April. Mint spoke to the former Prime Minister and JD(S) chief in Tumakuru. Edited excerpts:\\n\\n\\nThere is a lot of talk about Modi and his speeches where he does not talk about things he did not do. About 70% of the assurances made in 2014 remain unfulfilled. He could not make India corruption-free and there has been no skill development either. Unemployment is really high and farmers across states are protesting. Why didn\\u2019t the BJP think of putting \\u20b96,000 into farmers\\u2019 accounts earlier? The price of gas cylinders is more than \\u20b91,000. Eating a dosa in a small hotel also attracts goods and services tax.

Almost 90% of the Hindu youth supporters of Left parties did not disapprove of eating beef. Disapproval of beef consumption was the highest among the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters and found moderate support among the youth supporters of regional parties.\\n\\n\\nThere are other layers in the social picture. The idea of inter-caste marriage, according to the CSDS-KAS survey, found greater acceptance among the married respondents, even as the bulk of them had married within their own caste. Further, about a half of the unmarried youth preferred an arranged marriage and only around a tenth among them wish for \\u201ca love marriage\\\". And, in a clear illustration of the economic distress of rural India, the number of unmarried youth in rural areas is rising sharply when compared with that in cities.\\n\\n\\nRegional cultures offer a space of belonging in the lives of youth. While many millennials strongly identify as Indians, regional identities also have a strong appeal to them. A close embrace of regional identities\\u2014the Malayalees, the Assamese and the Gujaratis, among others\\u2014is likely to matter in the scheme of their political priorities. The Kannadiga millennial might not have taken to the streets over the use of Hindi language in metro stations in Bengaluru last year. Yet, she vigorously supports the Kannada cause on social media platforms, assists in the development of free software to help non-Kannadigas learn Kannada and helps build internet content in Kannada.\\n\\n\\nIt appears that the millennials share more with the older generations inside their states than with their peers elsewhere in India. For instance, in states where the older voters prefer regional parties, the youth too supported these parties. Indeed, the support for regional parties among the youth matches that for the BJP and far exceeded that for the Congress.\\n\\n\\nInside the states, political culture shifts between urban and rural areas. In rural India, where ties of clan and caste tend to be strong, familial inheritance of political power is more likely to seem acceptable than in urban India. Whereas the countryside demands adequate farm prices and affordable education and healthcare, urban India tends to obsess more over the quality of physical infrastructure. A healthy diet, clean air and respect for animal rights, which are among the values shaping the moral imagination of the urban middle-class youth, hardly resonate as political issues in rural India.\\n\\n\\nThe urban and rural locations of the millennials, therefore, translate into a marked difference in their political values.\\n\\n\\nThe urban-rural divide parallels the linguistic divide between English and Indian languages. The recent remarks of the head of the Karnataka BJP social media unit, Balaji Srinivas, disclose an awareness of this detail: \\u201cWe have concentrated on generating content in Kannada this time around\\u201495% of our content will be in Kannada.

Add to it a weavers\\u2019 community that is angry.\\n\\n\\nWhile the big ticket projects are a symbol of New Smart Nagpur, a growing middle-class aspiration, and a signature of Gadkari\\u2019s obsession with everything big, the city\\u2019s underbelly is full of problems. There is growing joblessness; growing desperation; huge in-migration; and big unorganized sector. \\u201cThis (the metro) is good, but we need more opportunities here,\\\" chuckled a young Utkarsh Dandekar, an undergraduate from one of Nagpur\\u2019s pre-eminent educational institution, the Hislop College. He has brought his aunt for a joy ride. \\u201cMost of my friends will move out for jobs,\\\" he says, as he boards the metro.\\n\\n\\nThere is a great divide: Nagpur has at least \\u20b965-70,000 crore worth of infrastructure projects in pipeline, but the city hasn\\u2019t been creating secure and well-paid jobs.\\n\\n\\nPatole, a former MLA from Sakoli who contested the 2014 election on a BJP ticket and won, before he locked horns with Modi and quit the BJP to return to the Congress fold, is a Kunbi. But of a sub-caste that does not exist in Nagpur. Plus, he does not have his own following in the city. What he has, though, is the strong support of the Congress\\u2019 central leadership. He has been picked up over a couple of local favourites.\\n\\n\\nPatole has a rural base. He was made the in-charge of the All India Kisan Congress for that reason. He now finds himself leading a battle in a transforming urban landscape. With less than ten days to go for polls, he lacks a strategy and issues to fight against Gadkari.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, Gadkari commands popularity; has a carefully built image of a do-gooder, and has a silent campaign going in his favour that he is a prime ministerial candidate in case the BJP stops below 200 seats. In April 2014, before elections, Gadkari made two promises: one, he would strive for a separate statehood to Vidarbha; two, replace tar roads with cement roads that have long life. Nagpur trusted him. He defeated the seven-time Congress MP Vilas Muttemwar by a huge margin and consigned him to political irrelevance.\\n\\n\\nIn early March, when he asked his workers and policemen to bash up the statehood supporters who shouted slogans against him at his public meeting in Nagpur, it was a complete contrast to his 2014 position. Cement roads are replacing every single arterial road; every service under the NMC has been privatized, and Nagpur is officially a smart city, but the promise of statehood and returning the city its state capital status has become a casualty. New migrants don\\u2019t have a stake in this issue. And both Gadkari and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis seem to have forgotten their love for an issue they rode on, until 2014.\", \"SECTION\": 0}, {\"STORY\": \"While new wireless and satellite technologies have been invented in the decades since, cables remain the fastest, most efficient and least expensive way to send information across the ocean. And it is still far from cheap: Google would not disclose the cost of its project to Chile, but experts say subsea projects cost up to $350 million, depending on the length of the cable.\\n\\n\\nIn the modern era, telecommunications companies laid most of the cable, but over the past decade, U.S. tech giants started taking more control. Google has backed at least 14 cables globally. Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft have invested in others, connecting data centres in North America, South America, Asia, Europe and Africa, according to TeleGeography, a research firm.\\n\\n\\nCountries view the undersea cables as critical infrastructure and the projects have been flash points in geopolitical disputes. Last year, Australia stepped in to block Chinese technology giant Huawei from building a cable connecting Australia to the Solomon Islands, for fear it would give the Chinese government an entry point into its networks.\\n\\n\\nYann Durieux, a ship captain, said one of his most important responsibilities was keeping morale up among his crew during the weeks at sea. Building the infrastructure of our digital world is a labour-intensive job.\\n\\n\\nWith 53 bedrooms and 60 bathrooms, the Durable can hold up to 80 crew members. The team splits into two 12-hour shifts.

There are also 300 rolls of paper towels, 500 rolls of toilet paper, 700 bars of soap and almost 600 pounds of laundry detergent. No alcohol is allowed on board.\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI still get seasick,\\\" said Walt Oswald, a technician who has been laying cables on ships for 20 years.

Now, people in rural areas have their eyes set on whatever is called \\u2018urban\\u2019. Not very long ago, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam talked about providing urban amenities. Why?
